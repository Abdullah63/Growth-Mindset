## Creating A New WebSite
### In the biggening off creating a website you should take some points in consideration :
**1- Who is the Site For?**
Every website should be designed for the
target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.
**2-Why People Visit YOUR Website?**
Now that you know who your visitors are, you
need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.
**3-What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?**
It is unlikely that you will be able to list every
reason why someone visits your site but you
are looking for key tasks and motivations. This
information can help guide your site designs.
**4-What Information Your Visitors Need?**
You know who is coming to your site and why
they are coming, so now you need to work out
what information they need in order to achieve
their goals quickly and effectively.
**5-How Often People Will Visit Your Site?**
Some sites benefit from being updated more
frequently than others. Some information (such
as news) may be constantly changing, while
other content remains relatively static.
