# Equality, Relational, and Conditional Operators 
## The Equality and Relational Operators 
The equality and relational operators determine if one operand is greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal to another operand. The majority of these operators will probably look familiar to you as well. Keep in mind that you must use "==", not "=", when testing if two primitive values are equal.

## Logical operators
A logical operator (sometimes called a “Boolean operator”) in Java programming is an operator that returns a Boolean result that’s based on the Boolean result of one or two other expressions.

Sometimes, expressions that use logical operators are called “compound expressions” because the effect of the logical operators is to let you combine two or more condition tests into a single expression.
