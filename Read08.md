# Equality, Relational, and Conditional Operators 
## The Equality and Relational Operators 
The equality and relational operators determine if one operand is greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal to another operand. The majority of these operators will probably look familiar to you as well. Keep in mind that you must use "==", not "=", when testing if two primitive values are equal.

|  >  |  greater than |
|>=   |  greater than or equal to  |
|  < |  less than |
|<=     |     less than or equal to  |
## Logical operators
A logical operator (sometimes called a “Boolean operator”) in Java programming is an operator that returns a Boolean result that’s based on the Boolean result of one or two other expressions.

Sometimes, expressions that use logical operators are called “compound expressions” because the effect of the logical operators is to let you combine two or more condition tests into a single expression.
## Loops in Java
Looping in programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true.
Java provides three ways for executing the loops. While all the ways provide similar basic functionality, they differ in their syntax and condition checking time.

**1-while loop:** A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.

**2-for loop:** for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike a while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping.

**3-do while:** do while loop is similar to while loop with only difference that it checks for condition after executing the statements, and therefore is an example of Exit Control Loop.
