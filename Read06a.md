## HOW HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER ? 
There are many web languages available, however we’re just going to look at three of them. They are HTML, CSS and JavaScript and they are considered to be the backbone of the web. When it comes to web development there is front-end web development and back end-web development. These three languages are for front-end web development and are responsible for what you can see and do on a website. They are referred to as client side languages as they run in the browser (Google Chrome, Firefox etc.) of your computer. The browser translates these languages and the result of this translation is the visual web page.

It’s important to note HTML and CSS are not considered to be programming languages. HTML is a markup language and CSS is a styling language. JavaScript, however, is a programming language. Hence, they are all web languages, but they perform different jobs.
